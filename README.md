## Setup

Example usage:

Create a `.github/workflows/cloudquery.yml` file with the content of:

```yaml

  schedule:
    # Run daily at 03:00 (3am)
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'

jobs:
  cloudquery:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout a git repository with a pre-existing `cloudquery.yml` configuration file
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Setup AWS credentials (example)
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

          # optional, defaults to latest. Must be a valid SemVer version (e.g. v1.0.0) or latest
          version: latest

      - name: Fetch with CloudQuery
